I consulted with Leah when creating the Transcript for the Chatbot. Honestly, it was more that I was asking Leah how she did it lmao. I also went to Monday's office hours with Ab

This project was an interesting introduction to java. I found it hard to wrap my head around how to organize my code in an object oriented way. Office hours helped quite a bit, but I was getting stuck on my own. Specifically, it was hard to understand how to call variables from my main into a method. I could have just tried to code the entire chatbot in main, but I felt like that was undermining the point of this project. If you code the entire thing in main, it's pretty similar to python coding, since it's organized procedurally.

I'm still figuring out how to manage my time so these projects don't stress me out last minute
